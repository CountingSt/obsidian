Based on your notes, the process for deploying Cloud_KBS to manage local Obsidian notes under Windows involves several key steps:

1. **Windows Environment Setup**: Ensure that your system supports virtualization and that it is properly configured through BIOS settings if necessary.

2. **Installing Docker**:
   - Download Docker Desktop from their official website.
   - Install the software, making sure to enable all recommended options during installation.
   - Configure Docker by accepting its terms and skipping setup prompts.

3. **Running Cloud_KBS Container**: 
   - Create a directory named `Cloud_KBS` on your system where you will manage Docker files.
   - Write or copy a `docker-compose.yaml.txt` file that specifies the configuration for running Cloud_KBS, including details like image name, volume mounts, network settings, and environment variables. Set `OBSIDIAN_VAULT_ROOT` to the path of your local Obsidian vault directory and provide your own `ZHIPUAI_API_KEY`.
   - Run Docker Compose commands in the `Cloud_KBS` folder:
     - `docker-compose up -d` to pull the necessary images and start the container.

4. **Accessing Cloud_KBS**: Once the deployment is complete, you can access the Cloud_KBS management page at [http://localhost:9800](http://localhost:9800/) to manage your Obsidian notes through this interface.

This process involves setting up a Docker environment and configuring it with the necessary files to run Cloud_KBS for managing local Obsidian note libraries.
